This project is a simple overlay I created because I had trouble keeping track of the crosshair while playing Valorant. I would constantly lose my when flicking or aiming quickly, and it was tough to stay focused on such a small target. Itâ€™s really just something I made to help me focus better and not get frustrated by losing sight of the crosshair.
